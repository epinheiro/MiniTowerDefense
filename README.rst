MiniTowerDefense
****************
Project with the following premise: *mini tower defense where the player must defend a core structure from 5 waves of enemies, 
by constructing course obstacles and offensive tower to destroy them*.

This project is made in **Unity 2019.1.14f1** and scripted in **C#**.

**Initially the project should attend the following criteria**:
=====================================================================
| 1. Have a construction system (to build barricades and towers) that allows players to:
| (a) visualize the future construction position, 
| (b) confirm/cancel the construction of a new structure, and 
| (c) confirm/cancel the destruction of a existent structure;
|
| 2. Have a enemy AI system that:
| (a) direct the enemy from a specific spawn point to the core structure (their final objective), 
| (b) controls its health info and shows it to the player in a form of health bar, and
| (c) do not attack constructed towers nor defend itself from them.
|
| 3. Have a spawn enemy system that allows to:
| (a) spawn enemies from different spawn points in each wave,
| (b) spawn enemies in different formations (at least one from each: individual and group)
|
**The game itself have the following requirements**:
===================================================
1. It is supposed to be in 3D
2. The demo game should have a completed game loop (beggining to end)
3. The demo game consist of 5 enemy waves with time triggers

This project had the following liberties:
==================================================
1. The arena could be in any format
2. Visuals and UI were not important - *so were not focused by me*
3. It was possible to use external assets - *but I opt to program all by myself and only use Unity capabilities*
